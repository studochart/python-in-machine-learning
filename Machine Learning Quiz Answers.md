## Explanation of Answers

1. Machine learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed with rules.

2. While supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the three main types of machine learning, "prescriptive learning" is not a standard type of machine learning.

3. In supervised learning, the input variables are called features (or predictors, independent variables), while the output variables are called labels (or targets, dependent variables).

4. Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm used for regression problems, where the goal is to predict continuous values.

5. We split data into training and testing sets to evaluate how well our model generalizes to new, unseen data. This helps us detect issues like overfitting.

6. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new data.

7. K-means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups similar data points together without using labeled data.

8. Cross-validation helps provide a more reliable estimate of model performance by testing the model on multiple subsets of the data.

9. A confusion matrix is used to evaluate classification model performance by showing the counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

10. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal configuration of model parameters that cannot be learned from the data itself (like learning rate, number of trees, etc.).
